### Local Data Storage

The app stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

This data is stored using Apple's UserDefaults and remains entirely on your device. It is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Data Usage

The locally stored data is used exclusively to:
- Track your fasting sessions
- Display your fasting history and statistics
- Remember your preferences
- Schedule local notifications for fasting completion

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties** because we do not collect any data from you.
